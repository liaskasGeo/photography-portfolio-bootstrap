Photography Portfolio - Bootstrap Example

Welcome to the ðŸ“¸ Photography Portfolio Bootstrap Example! 
This project serves as a demonstration of a responsive and visually appealing photography 
portfolio website built using Bootstrap. As a junior developer, I crafted this site to
showcase foundational skills in web development and design.

Features:
Responsive Design: The site is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Bootstrap Components: Leveraging the power of Bootstrap, this project incorporates key components such as navigation bars, carousels, cards, and forms to enhance both functionality and aesthetics.

Sections and Pages: Explore the Home, About, Services, and Contact sections designed to provide a comprehensive overview of a fictional photography business.
